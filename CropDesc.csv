Crop,Crop description
rice,"Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa. The varieties of rice are typically classified as long, medium and short-grained.

Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

The pH value of rice is within the range of 6 to 7 pH.

Rice is mainly grown in rain-fed areas that receive heavy annual rainfall. That is why it is fundamentally a kharif crop in India. It demands a temperature of around 25 degrees Celsius and above, and rainfall of more than 100 cm."
maize,"Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring. Its root system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture.

Maize can be grown on a wide variety of soils but performs best on well drained deep loams and silt loams containing adequate organic matter and available nutrients. 

It is necessary that the pH of soil does not deviate from the range 7.5 to 8.5. Maize plants, particularly at the seedling stage, are susceptible to salinity."
chickpea,"The chickpea refers to the plant family of legumes, Fabaceae. These plants produce edible seeds, called pulses, that have high nutritional value. 

Two main varieties of chickpeas are the larger round light-colored Kabuli-type, , common in the United States, and the smaller dark irregularly shaped Desi-type often used in India.

The pH value of chickpea range from 4-6pH. The rainfall requirement of the crop for a single growing season as revealed by the program is estimated to be 436.7 mm."
kidneybeans,"This crop grows well in tropical and temperate areas receiving 60 to 150 cm of rainfall annually. Ideal temperature for better yield is 15 °C to 25 °C.Red kidney beans thrives on a wide variety of soils. However, well drained loamy soils are the best for its cultivation.
This crop is very sensitive to salinity and soil pH should be 5.5 to 6.0 to obtain better yields. 

Soil with high organic matter/FMY promotes more vegetative growth. Red kidney beans are cultivated in both Rabi and Kharif season in various parts of India. 
Sowing season of kidney beans varies from state to state."
pigeonpeas,"The pigeon pea is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. It is consumed on a large scale in South Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent.

World production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons.[15] About 63% of this production comes from India. Pigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.

Pigeon pea can grow on a wide range of soils, from sands to heavy black clays, with variable pH. However, the best pH range is within 5-7. The average annual rainfall is 916.6 mm for the crop growing period."

mango,"“The king of the fruits,"" mango fruit is one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruits with unique flavor, fragrance, taste, and heath promoting qualities, often labeled as “super fruits"".

The tree is believed to be originating in the sub-Himalayan plains of the Indian subcontinent. Each fruit measures 5 to 15 cms in length and about 4 to 10 cms in width, and has a typical “mango” shape, or sometimes oval or round. Its weight ranges from 150 g to around 750 g. Mango fruit is rich in pre-biotic dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and poly-phenolic flavonoid antioxidant compounds.

A rainfall range of 890-1,015 mm in a year is considered as ideal for growing mangoes. It's pH value ranges from 3.4-4.8."
grapes,
watermelon,
muskmelon,
apple,"Most of commercial apple tree varieties thrive in cold and wet climate, where a cold winter is followed by cool spring and summer. 
Most popular apple tree varieties thrive in regions where the temperature rarely increases above 32 °C. 

The apple tree can thrive in an average soil with pH close to 7, provided that is well drained and free from stagnated water. 
However, maximum yields are reported on fertile sandy soils and loams with pH ranging from 6 to 7."
orange,
papaya,
coconut,"The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos. It is one of the most useful trees in the world and is often referred to as the ""tree of life"". It provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. Trees grow up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and can yield up to 75 fruits per year, though fewer than 30 is more typical. 

Coconut is a tropical crop and grows well a hot climate. About 75% of the world's supply of coconuts is produced by Indonesia, the Philippines, and India combined. 

A total of 1000 mm is sufficient, if it is evenly distributed throughout the year. However, rainfall upto 3000 mm is also ideal for coconut cultivation. It's pH value ranges from 5.5-7.8."
