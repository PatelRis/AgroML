Crop,Crop description
rice,"Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa. The varieties of rice are typically classified as long, medium and short-grained.

Rice is the staple food of over half the world's population. It is the predominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries in North and South America and 8 countries in Africa.

The pH value of rice is within the range of 6 to 7 pH.

Rice is mainly grown in rain-fed areas that receive heavy annual rainfall. That is why it is fundamentally a kharif crop in India. It demands a temperature of around 25 degrees Celsius and above, and rainfall of more than 100 cm."
maize,"Because it is cold-intolerant, in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring. Its root system is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture.

Maize can be grown on a wide variety of soils but performs best on well drained deep loams and silt loams containing adequate organic matter and available nutrients. 

It is necessary that the pH of soil does not deviate from the range 7.5 to 8.5. Maize plants, particularly at the seedling stage, are susceptible to salinity."
chickpea,"The chickpea refers to the plant family of legumes, Fabaceae. These plants produce edible seeds, called pulses, that have high nutritional value. 

Two main varieties of chickpeas are the larger round light-colored Kabuli-type, , common in the United States, and the smaller dark irregularly shaped Desi-type often used in India.

The pH value of chickpea range from 4-6pH. The rainfall requirement of the crop for a single growing season as revealed by the program is estimated to be 436.7 mm."
kidneybeans,"This crop grows well in tropical and temperate areas receiving 60 to 150 cm of rainfall annually. Ideal temperature for better yield is 15 °C to 25 °C.Red kidney beans thrives on a wide variety of soils. However, well drained loamy soils are the best for its cultivation.
This crop is very sensitive to salinity and soil pH should be 5.5 to 6.0 to obtain better yields. 

Soil with high organic matter/FMY promotes more vegetative growth. Red kidney beans are cultivated in both Rabi and Kharif season in various parts of India. 
Sowing season of kidney beans varies from state to state."
pigeonpeas,"The pigeon pea is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. It is consumed on a large scale in South Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent.

World production of pigeon peas is estimated at 4.49 million tons.[15] About 63% of this production comes from India. Pigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.

Pigeon pea can grow on a wide range of soils, from sands to heavy black clays, with variable pH. However, the best pH range is within 5-7. The average annual rainfall is 916.6 mm for the crop growing period."
mothbeans,"The crop grows the best when raised within 25 degree Celsius to 37 degree Celsius

This crop is termed as one of the best ‘drought resistant’ crops. The amount of irrigation can be further cut down with the adequate amount of received rainfall.
The most appropriate amount of rainfall for this crop is around 500 mm to 800 mm in a year. Since, these crops are desert crops, they can sustain and grow well even with a rainfall below 500 mm in a year.

The soil that is mainly required for the extensive growth of the moth beans is properly drained loamy soils. They can grow easily on sandy soils as well. The pH of the soil needs to be within the range of 3.7 to 8.9."
mungbean,"The Mung bean, scientific name Vigna radiata, is commonly grown as a sprout. Other common names for the Mung Bean plant include Golden Gram, Green Gram, Wild Mung, and Mash Bean.

Mung beans are warm-season, deep-rooted plants whose specific hardiness and day-length requirements varies by cultivar, though most require 90 to 120 frost-free days annually. Mung bean plants require full sunlight or at least eight to 10 hours of sunlight daily.

Mung bean performs best in fertile, well-drained sandy loam soil with a pH between 6.2 and 7.2 and will suffer in poorly-drained, heavy soils. 

The deep-rooted mung beans are adapted to warm, dry climates and grow best with only three to five deep waterings during the growing season. If the soil is adequately moist at the time of planting, the first watering is not needed until about 20 days after planting. Irrigation timing and frequency needs vary depending on humidity, rainfall and winds."
blackgram,"The peculiarity of black gram is when ground with water develops mucilaginous character giving additional body to the mass. It contains 25% protein, 1.83% fat, 61.0% carbohydrate. 

The ideal soils with well-drained loam or sandy loam, black cotton soils are required for black gram. In general, the black gram grows in the area which receives about an annual rainfall of 800 mm.
Depending on the soil moisture, Irrigation should be carried out at 10 to 15 days intervals. Drip irrigation is a highly successful formula in black gram. It saves time, water, labour, and power.

The optimum temperature for better growth ranges between 25°C to 35°C but it can tolerate up to 42°C. The black gram is grown from sea level to 1800 meters. 

The optimum pH requirement is 5.5 to 7.5."
lentil,"Lentils are easy to grow and very hardy. Plants grow on branched vines averaging 12 to 24 inches tall.
Lentils can grow on various soil types, from sand to clay loam, growing best in deep sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. A soil pH around 7 would be the best. Lentils do not tolerate flooding or water-logged conditions.

Lentil plants thrive in areas where the weather is somewhat cool and where there is limited rainfall.  Ideal temperatures are around 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and the humidity should be on the lower side—30 to 40 percent is ideal."
pomegrante,"Pomegranate is one of the few fruit crops that can be grown in areas where other productive fruit trees are difficult to grow or the conditions there are prohibitive for their cultivation. It is a plant that grows mainly in the Mediterranean climate type of the temperate zone, characterized by mild winters and hot and dry summers.

It withstands temperatures that often exceed 38 to 40 °C and can withstand temperatures of 48 °C. As for minimum temperature rates, most Pomegranate varieties are not recommended for planting in those areas where temperatures fall below -10 °C (14 °F) in winter.

The best soils for the fruit trees are heavy loams, but they are able to tolerate a wide array of soil conditions and can even grow in clay or sandy soils. Optimal soil pH for pomegranate trees is 5.5 to 7."
banana,"Most types of bananas plants prefer to grow in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. However, some varieties can scorch easily and will do better in partial shade.

These plants love organically rich, deep soil with good drainage and a slightly acidic soil pH. They typically have poor tolerance for salt in the soil.
The ideal pH level of banana plant soil should be between 5.6-6.5

These plants thrive in warm, humid conditions, but they don't like temperature extremes. Even the hardy, cold-tolerant banana tree species prefer consistent temperatures ranging between 23 and 35 degrees Celcius.
"
mango,"“The king of the fruits,"" mango fruit is one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruits with unique flavor, fragrance, taste, and heath promoting qualities, often labeled as “super fruits"".

The tree is believed to be originating in the sub-Himalayan plains of the Indian subcontinent. Each fruit measures 5 to 15 cms in length and about 4 to 10 cms in width, and has a typical “mango” shape, or sometimes oval or round. Its weight ranges from 150 g to around 750 g. Mango fruit is rich in pre-biotic dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and poly-phenolic flavonoid antioxidant compounds.

A rainfall range of 890-1,015 mm in a year is considered as ideal for growing mangoes. It's pH value ranges from 3.4-4.8."
grapes," The grape roots are well developed, have a wide adaptability to the soil, and can be grown in almost all types of soil.

The soil most suitable for grape growth is sandy loam or light loam with loose soil, moderate porosity, and small bulk density. PH values are generally 5-7, and the most suitable PH value is 6-6.5. The PH value is lower than 5 or higher than 8 and the grapes do not grow well.

Grapes are generally produced in areas with a mean annual temperature of 10-20°C. Very little growth occurs below 10°C. Grapes require winter temperatures cool enough to induce vine dormancy, and a growing season long enough to allow fruit development."
watermelon,"Watermelon is a warm-season frost-tender annual plant that produces large, juicy fruits late in the summer. Watermelon plants love the heat, and need a long and warm growing season of at least 70 to 85 days, depending on the variety, to produce sweet fruit. 

They grow best when daytime temperatures fall between 21 and 26 degrees Celcius,

Watermelon grows best in fertile, well-draining, sandy loam soils. Most soils benefit from incorporating a few inches of organic compost before planting, and perhaps some fertilizer as well.
Although the watermelon's deep root system makes it relatively drought-tolerant, the plant requires an abundance of water to produce healthy fruit. "
muskmelon,"Muskmelon plants flourish well under warm climate and cannot tolerate frost. The optimum temperature for germination of the seed is 27-30°C. 
With the increase in temperature, the plants complete their vegetative growth earlier. Stormy weather particularly dust storm during flowering reduces fruit setting.

A well drained loamy soil is preferred. Lighter soils which warm up quickly in spring are usually utilized for early yields, and in heavier soils, the vine growth will be more and fruit maturity will be delayed.

Muskmelon is sensitive to acidic soils. The crop can not be grown successfully below pH of 5.5. It prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Alkaline soils with high salt concentration are also not suitable."
apple,"Most of commercial apple tree varieties thrive in cold and wet climate, where a cold winter is followed by cool spring and summer. 
Most popular apple tree varieties thrive in regions where the temperature rarely increases above 32 °C. 

The apple tree can thrive in an average soil with pH close to 7, provided that is well drained and free from stagnated water. 
However, maximum yields are reported on fertile sandy soils and loams with pH ranging from 6 to 7."
orange,"The climate is the most important parameter for selecting the location of an orange field. The climate mostly determines the success of the orange farm and the quality of citrus fruits, while soil and water determine in general terms the productivity of orange trees. Cold is the most important enemy of an orange tree.

Temperatures below 32° F (0 ° C) are dangerous for the orange tree, especially when maintained for long periods.
High temperatures may also prove critical for the productivity of trees. High-speed and cold winds can also cause damage to trees, vegetation reduction, loss of fruits and deterioration of their quality.

Orange trees need a soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5, which is slightly acidic to neutral range.
One soil requirement for orange tress is good drainage. These citrus trees tolerate dry soil conditions, but do not survive wet clay-heavy soils.
Since most of the tree’s roots are in the top 2 to 3 feet of ground, it is sensitive to excess water."
papaya,"Papaya is a herbaceous plant of relatively rapid growth and short life. This is the reason why it’s not commercially profitable to cultivate mature papaya trees for longer than 3 years because the fruit yield gets low afterward.

Papaya tree requires hot conditions. Papaya tree should be cultivated in the summer season.
The temperature should be around 40 degrees. Low temperatures lead to slow growth of the plant, and higher temperatures cause low production.
It arises exclusively from February-March to May to October.

The ideal growing medium must be loamy and have adequate content of organic matter with good moisture retention capacity and efficient drainage. Soil that is more than a meter deep is suitable.
The pH of the soil should between 6.5 - 7.5is for its cultivation."
coconut,"The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only living species of the genus Cocos. It is one of the most useful trees in the world and is often referred to as the ""tree of life"". It provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. Trees grow up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and can yield up to 75 fruits per year, though fewer than 30 is more typical. 

Coconut is a tropical crop and grows well a hot climate. About 75% of the world's supply of coconuts is produced by Indonesia, the Philippines, and India combined. 

A total of 1000 mm is sufficient, if it is evenly distributed throughout the year. However, rainfall upto 3000 mm is also ideal for coconut cultivation. It's pH value ranges from 5.5-7.8."
cotton,"Cotton grows in tropical and subtropical locations. It does not do well in regions that have prolonged dry or wet spells. Cotton plants can attain a height of 15 to 20 feet.

Under ideal growing conditions, the temperature should hover between 32 to 35 degrees Celcius.

Excessive morning rain can render the cotton plant sterile. The flowers fill with water, which disrupts pollination, and the plant does not get fertilized. Saturated soil from rainy weather also causes the plant to not produce adequate cotton bolls.

Cotton plants require full sunlight to adequately grow and produce bolls. If full sunlight is not received, the boll production will be dramatically reduced or stunted. Excessively cloudy or overcast days will reduce the light that the cotton plant needs to produce adequate sugars, so its cotton yield will be dramatically reduced.

"
jute,"Jute is an important natural fibre cash crop just like cotton crop and grows well in hot and moist climate. Originally Raw jute was using as raw material for packaging industries only, later it has emerged as source for paper industries, textile industries, building & automotive industries,  soil saver, decorative and furnishing materials.

Jute crop grows well in rainfed, moderate, warm humid atmosphere and sunshine conditions. 25°C to 30°C is ideal for jute cultivation. Jute cultivation requires about 160 cm to 200 cm rainfall. Humid weather will result in good yield.

River basins or alluvial or loamy soils are best for jute cultivation.

Jute cultivation in red soils may require high dose of manure and PH range between 4.8 and 5.8 is best for its cultivation.
Jute cultivation requires good water resource(500 to 600 mm of water) and plenty of sunshine.

"
coffee,"Coffee is a tropical plant which is also grown in semi-tropical climate. The coffee tree requires heat, humidity and abundant rainfall.
Generally, coffee is grown on slopes having height between 600 to 1,800 metres. The suitability of slopes for coffee is because these are well-drained and also cooler.

Coffee requires an average temperature between 20°-27°C. Growth is most rapid during hot rainy season and during cool dry season berries ripen and ready for picking. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for the harvesting.

Coffee needs abundant rainfall, i.e., 100 to 200 cm annually. The hill slopes which receive orographic rainfall are thus best for coffee cultivation.

Coffee plants prefer acidic soil, so if your plant is not thriving add organic matter such as sphagnum peat moss to increase soil pH. The ideal pH range is closer to 6 to 6.5."
