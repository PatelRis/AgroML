Tech: Python, Flask, PyTorch, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Svelte, Scikit-learn, AWS

◦ Features: Full-stack web application Recommendation system has three features Crop Prediction, Crop Yield, and Plant
Disease Detection.

◦ Full-stack: Machine Learning + Deep Learning based web application(Agriculture domain) develop on Svelte and
integrated front-end & back-end with FLask API & deployed using AWS(EC2 instance).

◦ ML+DL models: Crop prediction(Multi-class classification analysis) we used Random Forest gives 99% accuracy Crop
yield(Regression analysis) used DecisionTreeRegressor gives 98.2% accuracy & Plant disease used ResNet architecture
gives 99.2% accuracy.
